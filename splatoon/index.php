<h1>splatoon (fanart)</h1>

<p>Thanks to Nintendo, a game about squid with guns is a fundamental part of my identity.</p>

<p>My Splatoon octoling is how I see myself and how I'd like others to visualize my presence online, despite the fact that I have a physical form. I'm so attached to my octoling's design that I have commissioned just about the same amount of art for every other fandom combined as I have for art of my octoling. I've been playing since 2018, and I'm sure I'll commission more art with each new game.</p>

<p>Some of this art has been gifted to me by friends. I was also on a competitive team, <big>Inkblot Dropouts</big>, for about a year, so some group art is here. And my friend <a href="https://togekissies.tumblr.com">Rae</a> and I have been playing Splatoon together basically since we both got really invested in it in 2018, so we've commissioned some art of our octolings together as well.</p>

<p>For alt text purposes: my octoling has tan skin, the feminine option ponytail, and bright pink ink. Her outfit in Splatoon 2 is a black bandana, hothouse hoodie, and Annaki Arachno boots, with the custom hydra splatling as her main weapon. In Splatoon 2, her outfit is the tentaclinger earring (sometimes visible), Moby knit, and the Annaki Tigers, with the vanilla tri-stringer (standard skin) as her main weapon.</p>

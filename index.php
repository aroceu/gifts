<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>This is a gallery of virtual things I have commissioned and things people have given me, either as part of an event or simply because wanted to. I adore the things people make for me very much and want to show them off here, in equal part if I paid for them or if I didn't.</p>

<p>Please take a look around and be sure to check out the creators if they're still around as well! <heart></heart></p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Some gifts or works are not linked due to now being removed or not publicly accessible in some way. However, I still like archiving that they exist.</li>
		<li>Fanart also includes personal edits.</li>
		<li>There are some pieces of art that I don't remember the artist's name of and didn't save it anywhere. Sorry! If you happen to be the artist of one of these pieces, please reach out.</li>
	</ul>
